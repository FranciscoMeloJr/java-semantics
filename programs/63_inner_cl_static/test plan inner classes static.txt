Part 1. Instance member visibility/access modes from outer class to inner class.
Part 2. Instance member visibility/access modes from inner class to outer class.
Part 3. Static member visibility from inner class to outer class.
Part 4. Inner class declaration access modes.

Part 7. Three-level class nesting and other.

Note: This test suite doesn't cover any shadowing/obscuring cases.
  Those will be covered in the test suite for Names.

101. Simple inner class. Classes A, A.B. Instantiate and toString() both from main().
102. Access inner class from outer one. Class A.
  A have the following members, declared in order:
  - class B {toString()}
  - toString() - calls inner classes toString()
  - class C {toString()}

103. Inner class members.
  Inner class A.B have members of all access modes:
  - private a
  - package b
  - protected c
  - public d
  - private f()
  - package g()
  - protected h()
  - public k()
  Instantiate A.B from A and access all members.

104. Inner class access modes. Classes p1.A, p1.A.B, p1.A.C. p1.A.B members:
    - private f(byte)
    - package f(short)
    - protected f(int)
    - public f(long)
  Call f(byte) from:
    - p1.A.B()
    - p1.A.C()
    - p1.A()
    - p1.Test1
    - <default>.Test2

105. Inner class as derived class.
  classes A, B, A.C < B.
  B members:
    - String a
    - String f()
    - String g()
  A.C members:
    - String a
    - String f()

  print a, f(), g() on targets (A.C)A.C and (A)A.C.

106. Inner class implements interface.
  class A, interface I1, class A.C
  I1:
    - String f();
  A.C:
    - String f()
  Print ((I1)A.C).f().

201. Inner class have reference to outer class.
  A, A.B. Members:
  - A: String id
  - A.B: A parent,
  - A.B: toString() (prints parent)
  Instantiate and print A.B.

202. Inner class calls outer class members of all modes.
  A, A.B.
  A members:
    - private a
    - package b
    - protected c
    - public d
    - private f()
    - package g()
    - protected h()
    - public k()
  Call all from A.B.

203. Inner class to outer class access modes.
  Classes p1.A < p1.B < p2.C, p1.D, p1.A.E
  Classes p1.A, p1.B, p2.C, p1.D have overloaded methods f(), g(), h() and k()
  respectively, with diff access modes. Call all with argument byte from p1.A.E.

301. Static member access from inner class to outer class by simple name.
  A, A.B.
  Members:
    - static A.a,
    - static A.f()
    Call them as A.a, A.f(), a, f() from A.B.

401. Inner class declaration access modes.
  Class A. Class A inner classes:
    - private A.Pri
    - package A.Pack
    - protected A.Prot
    - public A.Pub
    - public A.InnerTest
  Tests. Instantiate the following classes.
    - from main:
      - A.Pack
      - A.Prot
    - from A:
      - A.Pri
      - A.Pack
      - A.Prot
      - A.Pub
    - from A.InnerTest:
      - A.Pri
      - A.Pack
      - A.Prot
      - A.Pub

501. Inner class qualifiers:
  Classes p1.A, p1.A.B,
    - p1.A.B.toString().
  Instantiate A.B from A as:
    - new p1.A.B()
    - new A.B()
    - new B().

502. Inner class qualifiers disambiguation.
  Classes p1.A, p1.B, p2.B, p1.A.C, p1.B.C, p2.B.C

  From the context p1.A, instantiate the expressions:
    - new C()
    - new B.C()
    - new p2.B.C()

503. Inner class qualifiers disambiguation with imports.
  classes: C, p1.B, p1.B.C, p2.B, p2.D.C
  from main import p1.*, p2.D.
  Instantiate:
    - C, B.C, D.C.

504. Inner class disambiguation with outer class access modes.
  classes:
    - public p1.A, public p1.A.C
    - package p1.B, public p2.B.C
    - package p2.A, public p2.A.C
    - public p2.B, public p2.B.C
  main class imports p1.*, p2.* Instantiate from main:
    - new A.C()
    - new B.C()
