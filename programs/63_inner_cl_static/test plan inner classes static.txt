101. Simple inner class. Classes A, A.B. Instantiate and toString() both from main().
102. Access inner class from outer one. Class A.
  A have the following members, declared in order:
  - class B {toString()}
  - toString() - calls inner classes toString()
  - class C {toString()}

103. Inner class members.
  Inner class A.B have members of all access modes:
  - private a
  - package b
  - protected c
  - public d
  - private f()
  - package g()
  - protected h()
  - public k()
  Instantiate A.B from A and access all the members.

104. Inner class access modes. Classes p1.A, p1.A.B, p1.A.C, p1.Test, Test2. p1.A.B members:
    - private f(byte)
    - package f(short)
    - protected f(int)
    - public f(long)
  Call f(byte) from:
    - p1.A.B()

    - String a
    - String f()

  print a, f(), g() on targets (A.Inner)A.Inner and (B)A.Inner.

106. Inner class implements interface.
  class A, interface I1, class A.C
  I1:
    - String a;
    - String f();
  A.C:
    - String f()
  Print ((I1)A.C).f().

201. Inner class have a reference to the outer class.

  - A: String id
  - A.B: A parent,
  - A.B: toString() (prints parent)
  Instantiate and print A.B.

202. Inner class calls outer class members of all modes.

    - private a
    - package b
    - protected c
    - public d
    - private f()

  respectively, with diff access modes. Call all with argument byte from p1.P1A.Inner.
