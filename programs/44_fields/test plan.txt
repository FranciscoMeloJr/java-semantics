Testing class initialization sequence
  - the last feature remaining for full support of non-static semantics of classes.

Part 1 Fields
1. fields and inheritance.

Individual tests:
101. Fields with unqualified access. Read and write a field from inside the class.
102. Use a field of type reference. Pass a reference as a method argument.
11. One class with fields.
12. Subclass/superclass with fields, different names. Access from derived class.
13. Fields hiding. Subclass/superclass with fields, same name, access from both base and derived class.
131. Fields hiding. Subclass/superclass with fields, same name, access from both base and derived class.
  Now fields are accessed locally, via unqualified expressions.
132. B < A. B.x, A.x.
Access a hidden field through super qualifier, cast to base class,
  or named reference to base class.
133. Accessing hidden fields through super in a three-level hierarchy.
14. Local var hiding a field. Class with a field, method with a local var with the same name.
  Access both from within and outside var scope. Also use this.field.
15. Param hiding a field. Class with a field, method with a param with the same name.
  Access both from within and outside method. Also use this.field.
16. Field default values. Class with fields of all relevant types, without initializer.
  Test their value.
17. Multifield. One field declaration with multiple fields.
18. Final field. A simple final field. Initialized in constructor. Null semantics.

Already tested in other suites:
  - catch param hiding a field
  - for param hiding a field
