Testing plan for int and long operators.

1. All operators for int: int to int, int to bool, bit shift, assign.
2. Int operators with overflow result : int to int.
  (no matter which kind of overflow)
3. All operators for long: long to long, long to bool, bit shift, assign.
4. Long operators with overflow result : long to long.
  Result should be outside int range.
5. Several specific overflow cases for int,
  targeting normalization algorithm:
  - no overflow positive res,
  - no overflow negative res,
  - overflow, positive before norm, positive after.
  - overflow, positive before norm, negative after.
  - overflow, negative before norm, positive after.
  - overflow, negative before norm, negative after.
  and maybe some others.

Right now just + - and * are checked for overflow.
I sould also figure out more ways to test bit operators and bit shift.
Generally all operators should be reviewed and questioned whether they can result in overflow.
