Test plan for switch statement.

1. Multiple swtch groups. One case for group.
2. Multiple switch groups. Multiple cases for group. Multiple trailing cases.
3. All as previous + default case. Default case is not the first one,
  not the last one, so there is a switch group after default and some
  trailing cases too. Default is in the same group with another cases,
  having one case before and one case after.
4. All as previous + break.
5. Interaction with loops. One loop inside a switch group, one loop enclosing
  the switch. 3 breaks:
    - break in the inner loop
    - break in switch
    - break in outer loop after switch
6. Interaction with continue. Switch in loop. Statement continue in switch.
7. Interaction with break with label.
  Switch in labeled block. Break with label in switch.
8. All like in test 4, but break is inside default clause.
  Testing the default clause + break combination.
