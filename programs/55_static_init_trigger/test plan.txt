    Test plan for static init triggering for classes and interfaces

  Specification highlights:
- Each class and interface is initialized at most once, before first use
  that requires static initialization.
- Static initialization is triggered immediately before:
  - a class is created
  - a static field is read or written
  - a static method is executed
- Before a class initialization, it's superclass needs to be initialized.
- Before a class or interface initialization it's superinterfaces need not to be initialized.
- When an initialization is triggered by a use of a class/interface member,
  it is triggered for the class/interface in which the member is declared,
  not for the class/interface used as a qualifier to access the member.
- Thus a class/interface initialization may trigger another class/interface initialization
  by triggering second type initialization conditions in it's own initialization sequence.
- As a particular case, there may be cycles between initialization sequences of several members,
  in this case default values of the cyclically referenced type will be exposed.
- Class/interface initialization is triggered only when a non-constant field is read.
  constant fields are initialized first, it is impossible to observe their default values.
  Their access do not trigger any static initialization.
  (We will not test the distinction between const and non-const fields,
  but we should use non-const fields when testing init triggers)

Part 1 Class initialization is triggered once.
  101. Class A. Call a traced static method twice.
  102. Classes A and B. Call a static traced method in each twice, interleaved.

Part 2 Class initialization conditions.
  103. Class A instantiation.
      ( Class A static method call was already tested in test 101)
  104. Class A static field read.
  105. Class A static field write.
  106. Class A all four triggers, only one static init.
  107. Class A with both static and instance init tracing.
    Static and instance members/inits interleaved. Instantiate A.

Part 3. Class init triggers superclass init.
  108. B < A. Static and instance init tracing. Instantiate B.
  109. B < A. Static and instance init tracing. Call static method on B.
  110. (C,D) < B < A. C instantiation, D instantiation. Static tracing.
    A and B should be initialized only once.

Part 4. When a static member is accessed. Init is triggered for the class that declared
  the member, not the qualifier class.
  111. C < B{f()} < A. Call to C.f(). Init in B, A.
  112. C < B{v} < A. Call to C.v. Init in B, A.

Part 5. Init triggering chain for class.
  113. A,B. Static init in B accesses field in A.
    Static sequence of B: {trace} {access of A} {trace}

Part 6. Class init triggering a cyclic initialization request.
  114. A,B,C, C triggers init of B, that triggers init of A, that triggers init of C.
    Call a static method on C. Default values of C should be observed. Tracing.
  115. B < A. A reads static fields of B. B reads static fields of A.
    Call a static method on B. Default values of B should be observed.

Part 7. Interface initialization is triggered once.
  201. Interface I1. Read a field twice. Trace.
  202. Interfaces I1, I2. Read a field twice in both, interleaved. Trace.

Part 8. Interface initialization conditions - no tests, we already performed them.
  (It's just field read)

Part 9. Class/interface init do not trigger superinterface init.
  203. A < I1. Class A instantiation. I1 init is not triggered.
    Access a field in I1 - I1 init is triggered.
  204. I3 < I2, I1. Access a field in I3. Then access a field
    in I1, then in I2. Observe init order: I3, I1, I2.
  205. A < I1{f()}. Instantiate A and call the method f. I1 init is not triggered.
  206. A < I1{v, getV()} Instantiate A and call getV() that returns v.
    I1 init is triggered.

Part 10. Init is triggered for the interface that declared the member,
    not for the qualifier type.
  207. I3 < I2{v} < I1. Access I3.v. Only I2 init is performed.
  208. B{v2} < A < I1{v1}. Call to B.v1. Init of I1 only.
    Call to B.v2 - init of A and B.

Part 11. Init triggering chain for class/interface mix.
  209. A, I1. Static init in A accesses field in I1.
    Static sequence of A: {trace} {access of I1} {trace}
  210. I4 < (I2,I3) < I1. Each interface calls a field in the superinterface.
    Init sequence: I1, I2, I3, I4. Call I3-> I1 observes I1's initialized values.

Part 12. Init triggering loop for interfaces.
  211. I2, A, I1. I2 triggers init of A, that triggers init of I1, that triggers init of I2, A.
    Read a field on I2. Default values I2 should be observed in A and I1. Tracing.
  212. B{f()} < abstract A < I1{f()}. All static and instance inits traced.
    B static accesses A fields, A static accesses I1 fields. A static instantiates B
    (after accessing I1). Observe static init order: A, I1, B. B observes partially
    statically initialized A, but fully instance initialized.
