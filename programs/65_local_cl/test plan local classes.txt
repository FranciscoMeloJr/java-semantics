  Part 1. Local classes and the immediate enclosing class.

11. A simple local class LB that extends a class A and prints something in the toString().
12. A local class LB that overwrites a method of the base class A.
13. A local class LB that overwrites a method test() in the base class A. Also have an own method and field,
  accessed by test().
14. A local class LB implementing an interface with method test(). Also have an own method and field,
  accessed by test().
15. Local class LB accessing fields and methods of the enclosing class by simple name.
16. Local class LB caling a superclass constructor with parameters.
17. Local class and hiding.
  - Class O, members: av, af(), bv, bf(), test(),
  - Class O.test().LA, members: av, af(), test().
  From LA.test() call av, af(), bv, bf(), this.av(, this.af(), LA.this.av, LA.this.af(), O.this.av, O.this.af().

  Part 2. Local class whose base class is inner, but not instance inner.

21. Base class is a static inner class, traced constructor with no args.
22. Base class is a local class in a static method, traced constructor with no args.
23. Base class is a local class in a static initializer, traced constructor with no args.

  Part 3. Local class with base class an inner or local class.

31. Base class is inner class from another lexical hierarchy, have a traced constructor with no arguments.
  Local class LB have a constructor with one argument - the qualifier of the base class.
  Local class's test() calls super.test() that prints something from its enclosing class.
32. Base class is inner class from another lexical hierarchy, have traced a constructor with two arguments.
  Local class have a constructor with three arguments - one for qualifier, two for the base class args.
  Local class's test() calls super.test() that prints something from its enclosing class.
33. Base class LA is a local class in instance context, have traced a constructor with two arguments.
  Local class LB have a constructor with three arguments - one for qualifier, two for the base class args.
  Local class's test() calls super.test() that prints something from its enclosing class.
  Instantiate two LB's - one with encloser O.this, other with another encloser.
34. Local class LB extending another local class and implementing a global interface.
  (Local interfaces are not allowed.) Testing polymorphism through casting the object
  to the class and to the interface and calling a relevant method.

  Part 4. Local class and the enclosing block.

41. Local class accessing local vars of the enclosing class defined in one single block.
42. Local class accessing local vars of the enclosing class defined in nested blocks.
43. Local class accessing a local var that shadows a field of the enclosing class.
44. Local class LA accessing a field of the enclosing class, that will be shadowed by a local var of the
  enclosing class after the body of LA.
45. Local class LA accessing a field of the enclosing class, that was shadowed by a local var of the
  enclosing class before the body of LA, but whose scope is over.
46. Local class accessing its own field, that shadows a local var of the enclosing block.

  Part 5. Three-level nesting.

51. Local class inside an inner class inside a top-level class. Accessing fields and methods of inner
  and top-level by simple name.
52. Local class inside an inner class inside a top-level class. Field and method with the same name
  in Outer, Mid and Local. Discriminate among them using this, Mid.this, Outer.this.
53. Three-level local nesting. Local class LA extending I1Factory. Inside it, local class ILB extending I1.
  Access final local vars from ILB.f(), LA.createI1() and O.createILB() by simple name.
54. Three-level local nesting. Local class LA extending I1Factory. Inside it, local class ILB extending I1.
  Inside O.createILB(): local vars a,b,c. Inside LA.createI1(): local vars a,b. Inside ILB.f()
  - local var a. Print a,b,c from ILB.f().
55. Local class, inside static method, inside a static inner class,
  inside a top-level class. Class members:
  - O: af(), av, bf(), bv, cf(), cv, test().
  - Mid: af(), av, bf(), bv, test()
  - ILB: af(), av, test().
  All members are static, exept those of ILB.
  Since all local classes are inner classes, they cannot have static methods.
  Access them by simple name from ILB.test(). Also discriminate using class qualifier.

56. Local class, inside instance method, inside another inner class,
  inside a top-level class. Class members:
  - O: af(), av, bf(), bv, cf(), cv.
  - Mid: af(), av, bf(), bv, test()
  - ILB: af(), av, test().
  All members are non-static.
  Access them by simple name from ILB.test(). Also discriminate using this, O.this, Mid.this, ILB.this.
  See $8.1.3 for the precise semantics of inner classes.

57. Local class, inside instance method, inside another local class,
  inside a top-level class. Class members:
  - O: af(), av, bf(), bv, cf(), cv, test().
  - Mid: af(), av, bf(), bv, test()
  - ILB: af(), av, test().
  All members are non-static.
  Access them by simple name from ILB.test(). Also discriminate using this, O.this, Mid.this, ILB.this.
  See $8.1.3 for the precise semantics of inner classes.

  Part 6. Multiple local classes.

61. Inside the same method, two local classes implementing I. I have method test().
  Call the test on both of them, using the same local var, and observe the difference.

  Part 7. Instantiation of local classes in the context of hiding.
71. Local class instantiating another local class from the same enclosing block.
72. Local class instantiating two local classes defined in nested enclosing blocks.
73. Local class instantiating a local class that shadows an inner class of the enclosing class.
74. Local class LA instantiating an inner class of the enclosing class, that was shadowed by a local class of the
  enclosing class before the body of LA, but whose scope is over.
75. Local class LA instantiating its own inner class ILB , that shadows a local class of the enclosing block.

  Part 8. Deriving from local classes in the context of hiding.
81. Local class LB implements two local interfaces I1, I2 defined in nested enclosing blocks.
82. Local class LB derived from a local class LA that shadows an inner class LA of the enclosing class.
83. Local class LA derived from an inner class of the enclosing class, that was shadowed by a local class of the
  enclosing class before the body of LA, but whose scope is over.

  Part 9. Misc.

91. Class O, method container(). Inside container local classes LA, LB.
  Class LB defines the inner class ILB < LA.
  Instantiate two instances if ILB - one where constructor if LA is unqualified.
  In another one the call to superclass constructor is qualified with an instance of
  O different than the instance enclosing LA.
  From ILB call laTest(), lbTest(). both will print a field ov from its enclosing O.
92. Local class derived from another class with static fields. Call the fields qualified with
  the local class name.
