Test plans for continue with label and other related statements,
  which might be affected by changes introduced by continue with label semantics.

Part 1. Continue-Label 1. One labeled loop.

01. continue label -> labeled while.
02. continue label -> labeled do. Continue on second iteration.
03. continue label -> labeled do. Continue on first iteration.
04. continue label -> labeled for.
05. continue label -> try/catch -> labeled for.
  Testing rule ContinueWithLabelPropagation.
06. continue label -> try/finally -> labeled for.
  Testing rule ContinueInsideFinally.

Part 2. Continue-Label 2. Loop or labeled block inside other labeled loop.
  Testing that continue with label propagates correctly through
  other loop-related and label-related constructs.
  In all tests below continue should match the external labeled while statement.

07. continue label -> simple while -> matched labeled while.
08. continue label -> labeled while -> matched labeled while.
09. continue label -> simple for -> matched labeled while.
10. continue label -> labeled for -> matched labeled while.
11. continue label -> labeled block -> matched labeled while.
