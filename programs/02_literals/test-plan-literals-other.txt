Test plan for literals other than integer:
In all tests the said literals are just concatenated to a string and printed to stdout.

1. Bool literals: true and false

2. Single char literals, standart input chars:
  lowercase letter, uppercase letter, digit, space, symbol.
3. Single char literals, same chars as used in named escapes: btnfr
4. Char literals, named escape: all of: \b \t \n \f \r \" \' \\
5. Char literals, octal escape: range 0, 1-7, 00, 01-07, 10-37, 40-77,
  000, 001-007, 010-077, 100-177, 200-377(extended ascii).
6. Char literals, unicode escape: range \u0000,  \uu0001-\uu0007, \uuu0010-\uuu007f, \u0080-\u00ff
  (others are probably not supported by maude). (There may be any number of 'u' in the unicode marker, so we'll test cases with u, uu, uuu).
