Reference operators.
All operators: =, ==, !=, cast, instanceof

Part 1: operator =
01. assign to object: object, string, array, userClass.
02. Object = null, String = null, array = null, userClass = null.
03. assign from null object, string, array, userClass to object.

Part 2: operator ==
04. ==true: object, string, array, userClass
05. ==true: string object w string, array object w array, userClass object w userClass, userClass w null
06. == false: object w object, string w string, diff. content, array w array, same content, userClass w userClass, same content
07. == false, object w obj string, object w obj array, object w obj userClass, obj userClass w obj null.

Part 3: operator !=
08. != false: object w object, string object w string, array object w array, userClass object w userClass, userClass w null.
09. != true, object w object, object w obj string, object w obj array, object w obj userClass, obj userClass w obj null.

Part 4: operator cast
10. cast from object to: object, string, array, userClass.
11. cast from object with value null to: object, string, array, userClass.
12. cast from base class to derived, exact type
13. cast from base class to derived, instance is more derived type.

Part 5: operator instanceof
14. instanceof true: obj right value instanceof object, string, array, userClass
15. instanceof false: object, userClass1 instanceof string, array, userClass2.
16. null instanceof object, string, array, userClass.
17. instanceof true: base class is exact derived class
    instanceof true: base class is derived class, instance is more derived class.
18. instanceof false: base class is not derived class
    instanceof false: base class is first derived class, but not second, more derived class.
    instanceof false: base class is one derived class, but not another one, unrelated.

Part 6: conditional operator ?:
19. obj = (?) string : userClass => string
    obj = (?) string : userClass => userClass
