Part 1. Simple-Break, updated. Simple break inside labeled statements.
  Test that simple break correctly interacts with labeled statements.
  It should propagate through labeled non-loops, and interact with labeled loops.
07. break -> labeled while.
08. break -> labeled doWhile.
09. break -> labeled for.
10. break -> labeled block -> matched simple while.

Part 2. Label-Propagation.
  Testing that label propagation works correctly and that unlabeled loop will
  not steal the label from it's enclosing statement.
  This tests start with name label-propagation, and all contain a labeled break
  inside an unlabeled loop inside another labeled statement.

1. break label -> simple doWhile -> matched labeled block.
2. break label -> simple doWhile -> matched labeled while.
3. break label -> simple doWhile -> matched labeled for.
