    Test plan for static members.
Part 1. Static methods.
Part 2. Static fields.
Part 3. Static initialization.
Part 4. Final static fields in interfaces.

  Part 1. Static methods

101. Static method call through Class.f() expression.
102. Static method call unqualified, from an instance method.
103. Two static and two instance methods in one class. Call all unqualified
  in an instance context.
104. Static method lookup, all the forms:
  6 possible expressions:
  - unqualified in static context
  - unqualified in instance context
  - this.f()
  - super.f()
  - object.f()
  - Class.f()
  2 possible target contexts:
  - method defined in the target type/ current class
  - method inherited. Test all possibilities.

105. Static method overloading, all versions of the method in one class.
106. Static methods access modes - test just public vs private access mode
  in one compilation unit.
107. Static protected access mode. Test that a static protected method can be
  accessed from a subclass in a different package,
  using an instance qualifier, while a non-static protected cannot.
108. Static method versions from subclasses are not accessible,
  even when calling them through instance qualifier.
  B < A, B.f() <sig A.f(), call to (A)B.f() have no access to B.f().
109. Static methods are not overwritten. B < A, A.f() =sig B.f().
  Call to (A)B.f() calls A.f().
110. Static methods hiding.
  A < B, A.f() =sig B.f(). Other variations by need.
  6 possible expressions:
  - unqualified in static context
  - unqualified in instance context
  - this.f()
  - super.f()
  - object.f()
  - Class.f()
  2 possible target contexts:
  - method defined in the target type/ current class
  - method inherited. Test all possibilities.

  Method hiding is described in: $8.4.8.2, $8.4.8.3

111. Hiding and overloading independence. A < B. A.f(int), A.f(long), B.f(int).
  From B, A.f(long) is visible.
112. Overloading through a mix of static and instance methods.
  Call from instance context. All methods are accessible.
  Class A:
    - f(byte)
    - static f(short)
    - f(int)
    - static f(long)
    Call via:
      - inside instance method, unqualified.
      - this,
      - instance of A,
    with all param types.

113. Overloading through a mix of static and instance methods.
  Call from static context. Only static methods are accessible.
  Class A:
    - f(byte)
    - static f(short)
    - f(int)
    - static f(long)
    Call via:
      - inside static method, unqualified.
      - class name A,
    with param types: short, long. Other ones will give compile-time error.

114. Overloading through a mix of static and instance methods.
  Inheritnace. Call through super.f()
  Class A:
    - f(int)
    - static f(long)
  Class B < A:
    - f(byte)
    - static f(short)
    Call via:
      - super.f() inside B, with all param types.

115. Overwriting vs hiding.
  A: f(), static g().
  B < A: f(), static g(). Call both from (A)a, (B)b, (B)a.

116. Unqualified static method in instance initializing contexts.
  Access a static method through unqualified expression in:
  - instance field initializer
  - instance initializer
  - super() call
  - constructor

  Part 2. Static fields

201. Static field, accesed though class qualified expression for read/write.
202. Static field, accessed through unqualified expression in static methods,
  for read/write.
203. Two static and two instance fields in the same class, all accessed unqualified.
204. Static field as instance counter.
  Class have one static and one instance field. Create three instances.
  Check that static field is the same, instance field is different.

205. Main method is executed in static context. Two static and two instance methods inside main class.
  One static field - instance counter.
  Call static ones from the static context, all of them from the instance context.
  Test that class counter is o before main instantiation, 1 afterwards.

206. Field resolution:
  We have 6 possible expressions:
    - unqualified f in static context
    - unqualified f in instance context
    - this.f
    - object.f
    - Class.f
    - super.f
  combined by two target contexts:
    - field in current class
    - field inherited from superclass.

207. Field hiding:
  We have 6 modes to access a static field:
    - unqualified f in static context
    - unqualified f in instance context
    - this.f
    - object.f
    - Class.f
    - super.f
  We have three hiding scenarios involving static fields:
    - static hides static field
    - static hides instance
    - instance hides static
  We should test every combination that passes static checking.

208. Fields do not participate in polymorphism.
  B < A, four hidding scenarios:
  static - static, static - instance, instance - static, instance - instance.
  Call all fourthrough (A)B ref. Field from A should be called.

209. Unqualified static fields in instance initializing contexts.
  Access a static field through unqualified expression in:
  - instance field initializer
  - instance initializer
  - super() call
  - constructor
