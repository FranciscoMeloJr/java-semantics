  Apparently in Java a private field may hide another public field from superclass.
This is not permitted for methods, but is permitted for fields. Thus, field access modes
are relevant.

01. Instance fields access modes in all possible pairs, combined with hiding.
C < B{v, higher access mode} < A{v, lower access mode}
Concrete pairs:
  - public, public
  - public, protected
  - public, package
  - public, private
  - protected, protected
  - protected, package
  - protected, private
  - package, package
  - package, private
  - private, private
Testing contexts:
  - B, unqualified
  - B, this-qualified
  - C, this-qualified
  - C, (B b)-qualified
  - external class in the same package, (B b)-qualified
  - external class, other package, (B b)-qualified

02. Static fields access modes in all possible pairs, combined with hiding.
C < B{v, higher access mode} < A{v, lower access mode}
Concrete pairs:
  - public, public
  - public, protected
  - public, package
  - public, private
  - protected, protected
  - protected, package
  - protected, private
  - package, package
  - package, private
  - private, private
Testing contexts:
  - B, unqualified
  - C, unqualified
  - C, B-qualified
  - external class in the same package, B-qualified
  - external class, other package, B-qualified

03. Multiple inherited field, private in class, public in interface.
  Access mode makes the reference non-ambiguous. Field in the class is static.
  B < A{private static v} ,I{v}.
  Test the following references:
  - B.v,
  - b.v,
  - B{this.b},
  - B{v}.
  - (B static context){v}
  All should point to I.v .

04. Multiple inherited field, private in class, public in interface.
  Access mode makes the reference non-ambiguous. Field in the class is instance.
  B < A{private v} ,I{v}.
  Test the following references:
  - B.v,
  - b.v,
  - B{this.b},
  - B{v}.
  - (B static context){v}
  All should point to I.v .

05. Interface fields are public.
  B < (A{protected v}, I{v})
  Test the following references:
  - (other package){B.v} - refers I.v
