Testing class initialization sequence
  - the last feature remaining for full support of non-static semantics of classes.

Part 2 class Init

2. field initializers.
3. instance initializers.
4. superclass-to-subclass init order.

201. Fileds with initializer, all initialized with constant expression.
202. Fields with initializer, some initializer exps refer to fields declared above.
203. Fields with initializer, initializer exps refer to fields declared below. Default values exposed.
204. Fields with initializer, forward reference, default values for all types tested.
205. Field with initializer, initializer have an assignment to other field declared forward.
206. Fields with initializer, refering to methods declared both below and forward.
207. Fields with initializer, refering to subclass fields/methods.
208. Fields with initializer, calling an overridden method from subclass. The method
  references fileds in the subclass which have initializers. The test should expose default values
  of the fields in the subclass.
209. Fields with initializer throwing exception. Test that all the remaining initializers
  and the constructor are not executed.
210. Using super in field initializer. Call a super field/method with the same name
  as a member in this class, from a filed initializer.

31. Field with initialized, then instance initializer, initializing the same field, then constructor.
32. Instance initializer, then field initializer, initializing the same field, then constructor.
33. Field, initializer, field, initializer, then constructor.
34. Inst initializer throwing exc. The remaining field inits and constructor are not executed.

41. Three classes, all with fields with initializer and noarg constructor. Test that the order is correct.
