    Precise semantics for the main method.

01. Main method is executed in static context. Two static and two instance methods inside main class.
  One static field - instance counter.
  Call static ones from the static context, all of them from the instance context.
  Test that class counter is 0 before main instantiation, 1 afterwards.

02. Main method argument type / chosing main class.
  A program with three public classes - one with the name before the main class, main class,
  and the third one after the main class. Classes one and three also have public static
  methods main, with one argument, but the type is int, respectively Object[].
  The main class have a method main with type int[]. Test that the main class is correctly
  choosen.

03. Main method return type.
  Three classes, all with a public static <Type> main(String[] args).
  <Type> is:
    - Object
    - void
    - String
  Test that the second case is chosen.

04. Main method modifiers.
  Five public classes, all with a void main(String[] args)
  Method modifiers are:
    - none
    - public
    - public static
    - static
    - protected static

05. Main method modifiers, other order.
  - one class with a main method like:
  - static public void main(String[] args)
  It should be accepted.

06. Main method argument, c-like array argument form.
  - one class with a main method like:
  - static public void main(String args[])
  It should be accepted.
