Testing plan for int and long operators.

1. All operators for int: int to int, int to bool, bit shift, assign.
2. Int operators with overflow result : int to int.
  (no matter which kind of overflow)
3. All operators for long: long to long, long to bool, bit shift, assign.
4. Long operators with overflow result : long to long.
  Result should be outside int range.
5. Several specific overflow cases for int,
  targeting normalization algorithm:
  - no overflow positive res,
  - no overflow negative res,
  - overflow, positive before norm, positive after.
  - overflow, positive before norm, negative after.
  - overflow, negative before norm, positive after.
  - overflow, negative before norm, negative after.
  and maybe some others.

General rules:
1. Test values: 9/3, -10/-4.
2. For bit ops, 3 tests per op: +op+,+op-,-op-, (-op+ is not necessary)
3. Operators to test for overflow:
  +, -, *, -(min possible value), ++,--, bit negation, or, xor, bit shift ops.
