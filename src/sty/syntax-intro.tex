This chapter contains the entire semantics of Java 5.
This syntax was developed by Shijiao Yuwen from Formal Systems Laboratory of UIUC.
It is an adaptation of Java-Front~\cite{java-front}, the same syntax definition used to produce the external parser for K-Java.
Although the syntax is fairly complete, it might still contain errors.
This is because at the moment of writing it was not yet used to produce a parser for Java, consequently it was not yet used to parse programs.
Also, only a small part of K-Java is now defined over Java syntax.
The rest of the semantics is still in AST form.
Thus, most of this syntax was not put to use yet.
Yet, the part of this syntax that \textit{is} used is expressions, statements, and for the rest of the syntax, the attributes (strictness and \texttt{klabel}).
Syntax definition was added to K-Java at a later stage of development, when the semantics for Java 1.4 was already complete.
