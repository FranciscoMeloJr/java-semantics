1. Removed all examples that heavily depend on JDK classes. This means examples 67, all starting from 79.  Our goal is to test the language coverage, not that of JDK.2. Programs generating big non-deterministic output: example 75, 78.3. Removed examples that are not complete programs.4. Eliminated pauses in multithreading-related tests. Also adapted some infinite-looping examples to be finite (e.g. 76, 77).5. Renamed classes containing main method to match the name of the example (where needed), as is the requirement of the test runner.6. Added @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") where needed, to disable javac warnings in java v7.7. Added chopped down JDK classes to make the example work, where possible.8. Reduced the number of iterations in some examples to make them finish in reasonable time. Like 250-500 iterations max.9. Removed part of the code that required unsupported API, such as drawing in example 72.
