This test suite is based on the example programs provided with JBook. We operated the following changes:
- removed all the programs that intentionally don't compile. Our semantics doesn't check for compile-time errors.
- removed a non-deterministic program related to multithreading.
- Added "public" modifier for main methods, to make programs compilable.
