\section{Abstract}
This is the \K dynamic semantics of the typed SIMPLE language.
It is very similar to the semantics of the untyped SIMPLE, the
difference being that we now check the typing policy (described in
the static semantics of typed SIMPLE) dynamically.  Because of the
dynamic nature of the semantics, we can also perform some additional
checks which were not possible in the static semantics, such as
memory leaks due to accessing an array out of its bounds.  We will
highlight the differences between the dynamically typed and the
untyped SIMPLE as we proceed with the semantics.
