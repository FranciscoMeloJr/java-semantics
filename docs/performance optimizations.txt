Profiling helloWorld:
1. K init: 8s
2. Up to process type names: 7.85s. (configuration was shorter, took less time to display it)
3. Up to process comp units: 8.95s.
4. Up to process class decs: 10s
5. Up to ProcClassMembersPhase: 14.40s
6. Up to ElaborationPhase: 21.30s
7. Up to ExecutionPhase, config not truncated: 21.93s
8. Up to ExecutionPhase with config truncation: 20.22s. So displaying the config takes 1.7s.

Optimization attempts:

1. Replaced 2 default elab heating rules with one: 20.03. -0.2s. Not that much.
2. Rewritten isElab to make use of ElabKResult: back to 20.25s. Function isElab is used really heavily.
3. Replaced some of isElab with isElabKResult: back to 20.02s. Good. I have to simplify default elab heating further.
4. Added customElabHeatingLabel() -> 20.05s. I guess we don't need this label in the end.
5. Biggest change: replaced one set of default elab heating/cooling with two sets:
  one for labels in defaultElabHeating and other for the rest. Result: 20.22s. This way is actually slower.
  Reverting to the state 2 changes back.
6. Reverted to point 3: 20.06. Everything is pretty much useless.
7. Introduced function isVarDecHolderLabel - 20.05 - same shit.
8. Replaced haveNoElabRes with haveElabRes - 20.05.
9. Improved isElabNaked => 20.04. Stopping here.
