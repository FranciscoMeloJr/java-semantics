List of implemented features:

1. Migrated kool semantics to java syntax.
2. Java array allocation.
3. Array length.
4. All integer and boolean operators, including bitwise ops and bit shift.
  Including unsigned left shift operator >>>. The only difference from java
  is that here integers have unlimited values, thus no overflow can occur.
  Also ternary operator ?:
5. All composite assignment operators.
6. Constructors, simplified semantcs. Constructors are just replaced
with methods with same name and return type void.
7. All statements which deal with single-threaded computation
  (e.g. except synchronized), according to JLS $14.
8. Support for the following JDK methods's:
  - System.out.print
  - System.out.println
  - Integer.parseInt(System.console().readLine()) - only this term, and no subparts of it.
(The bare minimum required to write any values to console, or to read integers.)
9. Support for all literals, all types and formats covered in JLS $3,
    with the following exceptions only:
  - floating point literals
  - escape chars with values beyond 127, in both char and string literals.
  (those are not supported by maude)




Limitations:
1. Id's refered in semantics cannot start with capital letters. This
should be resolved in K, otherwise we would need workarounds to deal
with java class names.

2. K syntax limitation:
A production cannot have a non-terminal of sort List{K} and another
non-terminal of sort some List, surrounded by terminals.

Solution: make the sort "some list" to have a non-terminal on just one side.
Should be reported as a bug.

Non-related to java semantics:
1. Investigated various java language test suites over the net.
  So far, the most adequate for this project is jacks/tests/runtime/jls,
  part of mauve.


Postponed features:
1. Assert with one argument should call AssertionError exception
  without arguments. Postponed until constructor overloading will
  be implemented.
2. After NPE will be implemented, all seqstrict constructs should be reviewed.
  Some of them should throw NPE immediatley after first argument evaluates to null,
  thus second argument should not be evaluated.
