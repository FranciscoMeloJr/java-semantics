    Plan for the refactoring of semantics inspired by JBook:

  Separation ofstatic and dynamic semantics.
Static semantics should compute anything that traditionally is computed at compile time.
Dynamic semantics should compute just what is computed at runtime. More precisely, we have to
move to the static semantics the following:
  - Deduction of compile-time type for each expression.
  - The right signature on method overloading.
  - Names lookup - resolution of each name into a fully-qualified name,
  or simple name, by case.

  Given that there is some dependence between those steps, we have to perform
those steps in certain order. Moreover, now we have to preprocess statement blocks before executing them -
the content of methods, static and instance initializers.
  So, we have to perform the refactoring in the following four steps:
1.ok. Perform a preprocessing of blocks, that recursively visits each term of the block but leves it untouched. This will be a new preprocessign step,
  after the preprocessing of classes members.
  It should not be a new global preprocessing. Rather it will be performed for each class after its members have been collected and the class reached the phase MembersProcessedCPP.
  Over this preprocessing we will be able to add certain transformations for certain KLabels.
2. Implement names lookup in static sematnics.
2.1.ok Implement elaboration of ExprName(X) into localVar or Field.
    for this. we need the following:
2.1.1.ok. Perform the hollow elaboration left to right in all KLists. This way local vars defined
    in a previous statement will be accessible in the next statement.
2.1.2.ok Create a new environment each time we meet an elab('Block).
  The easiest way to store environments during elaboration is as a stack of sets.
  Each time we enter a new block the new stack will be a copy of the previous stack.
2.1.3.ok Restore the environment each time we leave an elab('Block)
2.1.4.ok Save an entry in the environment each time we declare a var.
2.1.5.ok Do the desugaring of 'ExprName into localVar or Field.

2.2. Elaborate qualified expression names, no package yet.
2.2.1.ok. This qualifier.
2.2.2.ok. Class qualifier.
2.2.3. Object qualifier. - could be localVar, Field or a complex expression.
  In addition to elabRes we have to add another type of elaboration result -
  elabQual(K,Set) - the elaborated qualifier. K is the original expression,
  Set is the environment provided by that expression. Something similar to
  objectClosure.

2.3. Elaborate classes in the presence of packages.
2.4. Elaborate names in the presence fo inner classes.

3. Implement method static method signature lookup.
4. Implement static expression type checking and annotation.

  When elaborating a block, in order to distinguish between an unelaborated
and elaborated block, we will wrap elaborated blocks into elab(...).
