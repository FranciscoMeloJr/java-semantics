Version with true xorBool false not working: 8163.
Anything above don't work. At version 8190 the definition don't kompile.

At xorBool fix version (82xx) wrong maude rules are already present.

Last working version: 8510 (8518).
.maude file size increased, also test time increased. Now the time to rule the whole suite on
the server is almost 6 min.

Updated to: 8620 - everything fails. Compilation now takes 3 min,
  and resulting maude is 800k instead of 650k. Good to avoid.

Reverted to 8518.

Tried to execute tests 41..45 on the refactored version of java-semantics:
  complex version of packages. Takes 79s, all 81 tests fail. second run, without parsing: 58s.

On the original version of semantics:
  - first execution: 50s
  - second execution: also 50s, but all tests passed.
  It seems that we should revert to the simple package representation.

Version 9108, the last version before mauve was completely eliminated:
  Compilation - ok in 24s, all tests pass.

Version 9129: Contains a bug related to isKResult. Waiting it to be fixed.
Version 9136: Bug with isKResult is fixed, but another one with cooling of TypedVal awaits to be fixed.
