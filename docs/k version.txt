Version with true xorBool false not working: 8163.
Anything above don't work. At version 8190 the definition don't kompile.

At xorBool fix version (82xx) wrong maude rules are already present.

Last working version: 8510 (8518).
.maude file size increased, also test time increased. Now the time to rule the whole suite on
the server is almost 6 min.

Updated to: 8620 - everything fails. Compilation now takes 3 min,
  and resulting maude is 800k instead of 650k. Good to avoid.

Reverted to 8518.
