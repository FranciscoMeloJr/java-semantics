3. When multifile tests are run, changes in the test are not detected.

4. Some unexpected files are created in the semantics dir when we run kjtest.sh with argument
  one multi-file test.

5. When I run one single multi-file test, temp files are created directly in the semantics directory,
  not in .test

6. Write one more script: jdktest.sh that executes only the generator,
  and writes in test-results.xml the result returned by JDK java.

7. jdk-run.sh don't delete the temporary directories if the test contains inner directories,
  or even in any case when packages are used.
