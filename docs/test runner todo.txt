1. Write one more script: jdktest.sh that executes only the generator,
  and writes in test-results.xml the result returned by JDK java.
  Useful to verify the tests themselves.

2. jdk-run.sh don't delete the temporary directories if the test contains inner directories,
  or even in any case when packages are used.

3. Add a timeout of 30s to kjrun.sh, and also show execution time.
