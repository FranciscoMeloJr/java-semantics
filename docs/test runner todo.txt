1. Bug. Repeated evaluation of programs with compile-time errors without -clean attribute gives error
  first time, and ok the second one, after we correct the compile-time error.
  This happens when there is an error in the semantics too and k-java don't output anything.

2. Implement one more status message after running a test: timed out.

3. When multifile tests are run, changes in the test are not detected.

4. Some unexpected files are created in the semantics dir when we run kjtest.sh with argument
  one multi-file test.

5. Flush test-results.xml file after every written result. This way when runner is stopped
  in the middle of execution, xml file will still have the results acquired so far.

6. When I run one single multi-file test, temp files are created directly in the semantics directory,
  not in .test

7. Write one more script: jdktest.sh that executes only the generator,
  and writes in test-results.xml the result returned by JDK java.
