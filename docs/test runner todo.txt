1. Bug. Repeated evaluation of programs with compile-time errors without -clean attribute gives error
  first time, and ok the second one. This happens when there is an error in the semantics too and k-java
  don't output anything.

2. Implement one more status message after running a test: timed out.

3. When multifile tests are run, changes in the test are not detected.

4. Some unexpected files are created in the semantics dir when we run kjtest.sh with argument
  one multi-file test.
