1.ok. In the test report add attributes errors="?" failures="?"
2.ok. In the test report add attributes classname="dir" name="test file" to each test.
3.ok. Add a parameter to the test runner to specify classname style: simple or complete.
4.ok. Improved console output for the executed tests. For each test directory,
  print the directory name once, then for each test inside print
  just the simple name, indented, followed by the test status.
5.ok. Add to kjtest.sh the ability to pass many parameters using linux style
  -p1=v1, -p2=v2 or something similar. There should be some framework facilitating that.
  The bash "framework" only supports short arguments. I've implemented an intermediate version:
  aux-kjtest.sh requires arguments -threads and -clean, kjtest.sh and others
  only accept the list of target dirs as arguments. They all invoke aux-kjtest.sh.
6.ok. Add a timeout of 30s to kjrun.sh, and also show execution time.
