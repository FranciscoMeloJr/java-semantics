Implementing static members.

1. First we need to define precise semantics for main method. Right now
  main class is any class containing a static method.

1.1 We need to define main class to be the class having the exact main method:
    public static void main(String[]), with semantically equivalent variations.

1.2 Main method should be called without instantiating the class, in a proper static context.
  Right now it is called as: new MainClass().main(new String[0])
  We should call it as: MainClass.main(new String[0])

It seems that the solution is much easier: we simply have to pass to the configuration the main class name
  from the command line.
