1.) The link "AsmGofer Interpreter" starts the AsmGofer
    interpreter without loading any files. This link
    can be used to "play" with AsmGofer.
2.) The links "Compiler", "Trustful Machine",
    "Defensive Machine", and "Diligent Machine" start
    AsmGofer with the corresponding machine introduced in
    the Jbook.
3.) The links with "(with history)" start AsmGofer
    with the corresponding machine introduced
    in the Jbook. These machines contain an 
    additional "Back" button to undo execution steps.
4.) The file %JBOOK%\config (where %JBOOK% is the
    installation path of Jbook) contains configuration
    definitions for fonts and colors.
5.) If you want to use BCEL (Bytecode Engineering Library)
    or Jasmin, then you need the JRE or the JDK from Sun.
    Furthermore, you have to extend your CLASSPATH variable.
     - For BCEL  : %JBOOK%\BCEL.jar
     - For Jasmin: %JBOOK%\jasmin.jar
    where %JBOOK% is the installation path of JBook.
